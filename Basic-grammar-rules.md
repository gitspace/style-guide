We all need to refresh on these, sometimes.

###Comma splices and fused sentences

Comma splice refers to the incorrect use of a comma between two independent clauses. 

> Most stockholders favored the merger, the management did not.

A fused sentence is two independent clauses in one sentence with no seperating punctuation.

> The first section of the article was approved the conclusion will have to be rewritten.

These are relatively easy to fix.

A comma + a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) can join two independent clauses.

> Most stockholders favored the merger, the management did not.

becomes

> Most stockholders favored the merger, but the management did not.

**A semicolon (;) can join two indepent clauses that are closely related.** 

Semicolons signal contrast or addition.

> The first section of the article was approved the conclusion will have to be rewritten.

becomes

> The first section of the article was approved; the conclusion will have to be rewritten.

A semicolon will also precede an independent clause that begins with a conjunctive adverb (however, nevertheless, also, besides, hence, instead, moreover, etc.) 

> Most stockholders favored the merger, the management did not.

becomes

> Most stockholders favored the merger; however, the management did not.

**A colon (:) can seperate independent clauses if the second explains or elaborates the first**

> The store had a special offer: anyone who purchases dog food will receive a 10% discount on a cat.

If the indepenent clauses are not similar. Use a period to seperate.

> The porcupine was dangerous; I like cheese.

becomes

> The porcupine was dangerous. I like cheese.

####Exceptions

If independent clauses are short, parallel, and unified in meaning, commas can be used. This is called **Asyndeton**.

> They came, they saw, they conquered.

A comma can be used between two independent clauses if it offsets a statement from a question.

> These shoes are brand new, aren't they?

###Looking Closer at Commas

Serial comma: in a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.

> Red, white, and blue.

EXCEPTION: if an ampersand (&) is used in place of "and" the serial comma is omitted.

If conjunctions are present between all list items, no commas are needed unless the list items are long and delimiters make a sentence more clear.

> Red and white and blue.

If list items have internal punctution, a semicolon (;) takes the place of the comma as delimiter

> Red; white; and, of course, blue.

"etc.," "et al.," and "and so forth," are seperated by a preceding and following comma when they are the final item in a list.

> The Egyptians population studies, sarcophogi, stray notes, and so forth, were found in the tomb. 

If text is added that is inconsequential to the understanding of the sentence, it is offset in a comma pair.

June 7, 1823, is hardly memorable by most living people.

Same applies for nonrestrictive relative clauses that are usually offset with who, who, whom, or whose.

> I prefer to share the road with illiterate drivers, who are unlikely to read books while driving.

Any word, abbreviation, phrase, or clause that is an apposition to a noun (i.e. an explanatory equivalent) is set off by commas if it is nonrestrictive.

> Ursula’s husband, Enrique, is also a Scuba diver
> Ursula’s son, Roberto, had been a student of Sean Connory's

If the appositive is restrictive no commas should be used.

> The renowned poet and historian T. Russini scheduled a six-city tour for March.

If there is a weak parenthetical insertion with no internal punctuation, it can be offset with commas.

> All the test participants, in spite of our initial fears, recovered.

A dependent clause that precedes a main clause should be followed by a comma

> If you accept my payment, we will agree to our contract.

Coordinate adjectives: When a noun is precded by two or more adjectives that could, without changing the meaning, be joined by "and," the adjectives are seperated with commas. 

These adjectives can be rearranged and the sentence will still make sense. If the adjectives are not coordinate, no commas are used.

> It is going to be a long, hot, exhausting summer. 
> She has a young, good-looking friend. 

> She has many young friends.
> She opted for an inexpensive quartz watch.

Sentences that start with participial phrases or adverbial phrases should be set off by a comma. 

> After reading the note, Henrietta turned pale.
> To Anthony, Blake remained an enigma.

EXCEPTION: if the phrase immediately precedes the verb of the sentence, no comma should be used. 

> Before the footlights stood one of the most notorious rakes of the twenty-first century.

Oh and Ah: A comma follows an exclamatory "oh" or "ah" unless it is followed by an exclamation point or is part of a phrase (e.g. "oh boy," "ah yes").

> Oh, you’re right!
> Oh no! Ah yes! Oh yeah?

EXCEPTION: if the oh is vocative, not exclamatory, then no comma is needed.

> Oh mighty king!

When addressing directly, a name should be set off by a comma.

> Ms. Jones, please sit down.
> Jerimiah, your order is ready.
> I'm not here, my friends, to sell you mere cabbages.
> Dear Helmut,…

A comma should follow introductory uses of "yes," "no," "well," and the like.

> No, the commodore will not be eating his hat tonight.
> Yes, Rebecca has purchased all the tea in China.
> Well then, I suppose we might have to live in tunnels underground.

All uses of "namely," "that is," and "for example" are followed by commas.

> There are simple alternatives to the stigmatized plastic shopping bag, namely, reusable cloth bags and foldable carts.

When "or" is used to mean "in other words," it is offset by commas

> The compass stand, or binnicle, was stolen by the maid.

Abbreviations "i.e." and "e.g." should be followed by a comma

If clarification is needed, commas be be used between homonyms.

> Let us march in, in twos.
> Whatever is, is good.

Specific Dates: When a date is used with month and year, set off the year with a comma. 

> June 6, 1944, was D-Day.
> D-Day occured in June 1944

UNLESS they contain proper adjectives

> English department | Spanish department

**Academic honors**

> cum laude | magna cum laude

###Apostrophe Catastrophes

The apostrophe has two functions: to indicated omitted letter or numerals, and to form possessives.

Contractions of verbs are easily and regularly formed with an apostrophe.

> I'm for I am | It's for it is | They're for they are | Can't for can not

Do not avoid spelling out verb phrases; they can be more powerful. 
Negative verb phrases such as can not, do not, will not, etc., are more clear than their contraction equivalents.

Apostrophes can be used for omitted letters to represent dialect or speech in writing. This can be difficult to pull off well and should be used sparingly or reserved for dialogue.

> This flick will be rockin’ and reelin’ in theaters next month.

Apostrophes can be used for omitted numerals.

> The first baby boomers were born in the late ’40s.

####Possessive form

**Possesive singular of nouns end with 's**

> Steve's hairdryer | Marx's theories

**If the singular noun is proper and ends in an s, an 's is still used.

> Dickens's novels | Texas's beaches | Kris's hair | General Motors's CEO

Note: This is unique to Airspace style. The above is pronounced as Dickens's Texas's and Kris's and is written as such.

If the singular noun is not proper, and ends in an s, add 's

> That business's decision.

Plural possessives are formed by adding an apostrophe after the plural s, unless the plural of the word does not end in an s

> students' rights | women's studies

**For…Sake Expressions**

If word is a singular noun ending in s, just add an apostrophe

for goodness' sake
for righteousness' sake

Joint versus seperate possession

Closely linked nouns are refered to as a single unit when the possession in question is shared; therefore, the second item takes the possessive form.

my aunt and uncle's house
Minneapolis and Saint Paul's transportation system

When possessions are discreet, both take possessive form

my aunt's and uncle's medical profiles
Kris' and Tony's turntables
Blake's and Eric's beards

With compound nouns and noun phrases, the final noun takes the possesive form.

student assistants' time cards

If forming the possessive of italisized text, the 's is set in roman.

Years should NEVER have an apostrophe unless they are used as possessive

1980s | 80s | 1750s
1999's heaviest snowstorm

The plural of single letters can have an apostrophe to avoid confusion.

Billy received three A's 

THE GENITIVE
Adding an apostrophe to a noun makes that noun look like a possessive. But children’s choir, war’s casualties, Alzheimer’s disease, and similar constructions are genitives. The term genitive comes from a Latin word that denotes generating, or begetting. It is also related to the word genus, and like a genus, it is used to classify another noun. Unlike a typical possessive, the genitive doesn’t indicate ownership; it indicates some other relationship between the first and second noun.

A genitive can indicate: 
The source, as in the buyer’s counteroffer
The agent, as in the fielder’s error
The object of an action, as in the child’s rescue
The purpose, as in ladies’ lingerie
A type, as in a doctor’s appointment
Length, as in two weeks’ vacation

Careful writers use an apostrophe in such cases: teachers’ union rather than teachers union.

The genitive has two quirks: First, you can use it without the primary noun, as in We are going to the doctor’s. Second, you can use it after of to indicate possession. A dream of Jeannie (not the genitive) is different from a dream of Jeannie’s. In this case, the genitive noun (here, Jeannie) must be a living thing or a person, and the word before of (dream) must constitute only a part of the whole (all of Jeannie’s dreams). Thus, you’d write a friend of Bill’s—because Bill has many friends—and not a friend of Bill, the same as you’d write a friend of his and not a friend of him.
