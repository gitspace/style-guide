# Dealing with Public Criticism

As a genera rule, try not to read the comments on your article. The positive comments dont make up for the awful ones. But if you do decide to dip into the hellmouth here are some forulated replied to keep you sane. Originally by [@pourmecoffee](http://pourmecoffee.smallpict.com/?story=finePrint) with minor adjustments.

1. It is solely your responsibility to find the hilarity. No humor explanations.
2. Please tell me more about how I might use my time and talent to perfectly match your unique sensibilities!
3. I note your assertion of my (moral) (intellectual) (physical) inferiority.
4. I acknowledge your attempt at a (clever) (devastating) (hilarious) insult.
5. I recognize your effort to improve upon my original idea (from an opposing 6. ideological view) (with a slightly different twist).
6. I am willing to stipulate that you are a very big deal online.
7. I acknowledge your supposedly more (nuanced) (intellectually rigorous) (fancy-sounding) take on my short post.
8. I understand you are going to (block) (unfollow) (block/unfollow) me for righteous reasons.
9. I recognize the unfathomable injustice of my insignificant voice drowning out the singular wisdom of yours.
10. Thank you for praying for me.
11. I accept that my (candidate) (idea) (team) lost a contested outcome which you now assert as complete vindication of your superiority over me.
12. Thank you for the correction of a trivial (spelling) (grammatical) (typing) (semantic) error.
13. I acknowledge your extrapolation of personal preference into a blanket judgment of objective value.
14. I appreciate your candor, but it is none of my business what you think of me.
15. Thanks for (correcting) (criticizing) (dismissing) my subjective interpretation of something by offering up your own as definitive.
16. I confess to the exaggeration you identified. This technique is sometimes used in writing.
17. I acknowledge that you or someone tweeted/blogged the same or similar thing before me. Time constraints make it difficult for me to double-check the entire Internet before publishing. I don’t ever knowingly steal stuff, period.
18. I accept your (declaration of victory) (accusation of cowardice) over my refusal to (engage) (debate) (argue) with you.
19. I am in receipt of your unsolicited complaint about the relative (humor) (interest) (value) of a particular post.
20. I sense my writing displeases you. I suggest not reading it
