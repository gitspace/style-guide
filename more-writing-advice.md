##Helpful Writing Tips

1. Try to avoid overusing forms of "to be." Verbs like is, are, was, were, etc. tend to make writing passive. Action verbs are more engaging. Never use the passive voice when you can use the active. "The man was bitten by the dog," (passive) is longer and less forceful than "The dog bit the man." (Active).

2. Don't use the word "one" when you really mean "people." It's an archaic approach to formality. Try rewriting the sentence so neither "one" nor "people" is needed for it to make sense.

3. Not only is parallel structure helpful for readers, it's wrong to break from it. When making lists keep all levels of the list in the same tense, structure or verb form. This applies to words and phrases, and clauses. 
> Rick likes hiking, swimming, and riding a bicycle.
> Rick works quickly, accurately, and thoroughly.
> Rick told his grandma she should get a lot of sleep,not eat too much, and do warm up excercises before her cage match.

4. Try to avoid Who, That, and Which. They usually are not needed. Make an effort to scan your writing for "that" and remove them when making revisions. It hardly ever makes a difference. But, if you have to use them, know "Who" refers to people while "that" and "which" refer to groups of things. "That" introduces essential clauses. If you were to remove the clause following "that" the sentence would no longer make sense. "Which" introduces non-essential clauses. If you remove the clause following "which," the sentence still makes sense. 

5. Avoid overly complex words when simple ones function just the same. For example: don't use "usage" or "utilize" when you mean to say "use." Long words on their own don't make a writer appear intelligent. They must be used sparingly and skillfully. Save the ten-dollar word for the right moment.

6. Effect and affect are different words. Effect is normally a noun describing the consequence of something ocuring "The experiment had three effects…" where "affect" is a verb that means to influence. There is an exception. One can "effect a change." In that situation, effect is used as a verb.

7. Less refers to non-count nouns. Fewer refers to count nouns. 
> Less water, less decency, less sand | Fewer glasses of water, fewer decent people, fewer pails of sand.

8. While sets up a temporal relationship and does not fucntion to contrast to ideas. In those situations, use "whereas" or "although."
> My burrito was burning while I watched the sports match."
> Although Roberto likes Big Bird, I find oversized bird off-putting.

9. Since describes a temporal relationship whereas "because" desribes a casual relationship.
> Since I ate the whole coconut, I have become very ill. 
> Because I've been sick, I've been eating less.

10. Don't put contrast words together (*e.g.* "but rather," "yet although," "but despite"). Pick your favorite of the two.

11. Don't use "this" without a close and easily defineable antecedent. If it's at all unclear, follow this with a noun that specifies the antecedent.
> The looming deconstruction of the solar system caused the pigeon population of Ecuador to migrate to Quebec in order to find shelter before being anhiliated by the solar storms. This *finding* was studied for years to come.

12. Only use multiple qualifiers when they say different things. "brilliant genius," is redundant where "ambivilant genius" is not.

13. If the word "very" appears in your text, rewrite to remove it. Or, just cut it and see if the flow still works. 

14. Try to avoid the adjective forms of "certain" and "specific." "Certian things causes specific consequences" is not a useful sentence as it only establishes a vague relationship.

15. Remove "I believe," "I think," and "I feel," from all writing. As the writer, you are the authority on the topic. Your beliefs, thoughts, and feelings are implied.

16. Random doesn't mean arbitrary

17. Don't say something is interesting. Show how something is interesting so the reader comes to the conclusion on their own terms.

19. Avoid metaphors, similes, or other figures of speech you are accustomed to seeing. Clichés are too comfortable and make it difficult to produce an emotional response. Take the time to create your own images.

20. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out. You want to charge your language with meaning to the utmost degree. Extra words dilute meaning. Less is always better. Except when it's not.

21. Don't use a foreign phrase, scientific word, or bit of jargon if there is a understandable English equivalent. You always want your ideas to be accessible. If a technical word is needed, teach the readers to understand it.

22. Confidence and arrogance in writing are not the same. 

23. Spell out single-digit whole numbers. Use numerals for numbers greater than 9. If a sentence included two or more numbers, be consistent. "My ten children ate two pinatas," is an acceptable sentence.

24. Avoid superlatives at all costs. High levels of abstraction are difficult to live up to. Instead show the point a superlative would have made.
