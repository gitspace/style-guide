Commentary Ticker Guide
==========

The Airspace uniquely seperates seperates our content into the **commentary ticker** and the **main loop**. The commentary ticker (or just ticker) is analogous to the ticker tape that would constantly report the latest stock prices or news reports. Because of the Airspace's limited staff and resources, we will never be the forefront of news, but that doesn't mean we can't share the news with our readers in a essentially Airspace way.

The point of the ticker is to provide the readership with engaging or important content we have found elsewhere in publishing. To make this content unique to The Airspace, short commentary is added to a ticker post placing an important spin on the story.

Ticker content is selected by the individuals writing the posts but should overlap with the higher concepts The Airspace is aimed at: culture, technology, scholarship.

Ticker posts, due to their nature of referencing others’ work, should be kept short. This means they are only long enough to comprehensively cover the topic from a specific angle and not any longer. If you find yourself citing more than three sources, it might be better to convert the piece into a **main loop piece**.

This style guide discusses the anatomy of a ticker article.

###Magnetic headline

Your headline is the first, and perhaps only, impression you make on a prospective reader. Without a compelling promise that turns a browser into a reader, the rest of your words may as well not even exist.

On average, for every ten people that encounter your artilce, eight will read the headline, and two will read the rest of the article. Every sentence exists to move the story forward and propel the reader into the next sentence. This is what compels people to finish articles. The headline is the very first sentence, if it can't move a reader into the body of the article, it needs to be rewritten.

Every great story has an incredible headline it deserves. It's your responsibility as a writer to find that headline, even if it takes a great deal of time and requires you to throw out multiple bad headlines first.

####Verb + colon construction

If the source is a video, or audio selection, it is appropriate to use Verb + Colon construction. This means starting the headline with “Watch:” or “Listen:” or “Play:” This indicates to the reader that there is a video, audio selection, or game inside. These constructions are not mandated for this type of content, a typical headline can suffice. If you wish to include these cues, the Verb+Colon format must be used.

###Beautiful image

All articles on the Airspace start with an image. This image must encompass the essence of the story and the nature of both the source and the individual commentary. 

Don't settle for stock photos or contrived promotional material. Dig deep to find a great image. In most places the article is shared, the image or a thumbnail of it will be positioned next to the headline. It is another essential lure to bring readers into the story.

**Technical details for the leading image**
It must be 640 pixels wide, and between 480 and 270 pixels in height. This maintains a minimum aspect ratio of 1.33, and a maximum of 2.4. This range is most comfortable on the human eye and fits best into The Airspace layout.

**All images:**
Must be compressed .jpeg, .jpg or .png formats no greater than 100 KB.

**Image Adjustments:**
If any text is added to an image, it must be in standard Airspace typeface (Ideal Sans by H&FJ, available on Basecamp) unless otherwise approved by a creative director or editor.

**Uploading:**
Image adjustments, sizing, and compression should be completed before uploading to Wordpress. The image you upload should be the exact version you wish to see on the site.

###The Lede (rhymes with "need," not spelled "lead")

The lede is the most important part of the story, literally. It is the sentence or paragraph (or sometimes series of paragraphs) that contain the most essential information or concept you're trying to share. Don't confuse this with a hook (a sentence designed to draw a reader in) or the subhead (an article summary that works in harmony with the title or headline).

While the lede is the core of the story, it is not the story itself. Every sentence should move the story forward and have a clear relationship to the lede.

Sometimes the lede doesn't actually lead off the article. This is called "burying the lede" and it's not always a bad thing. 

-------

###References

Ticker articles are based of the journalistic work of others. To establish the credibility and authority of your commentary you must respect that original work. The best way to do this is through references, quotes, and citation. 

References can take many forms. It can be a block quote from the text of an article, it can be a video, it can be a song, or it can be a series of images. 

**Blockquotes**
When using blockquotes, do not quote more than 350 words at a time uninterrupted. If more than 350 words are required, include commentary or narrative between quotes.

Exceptions to the 350 word limit include reprinting the full text of a statement by an individual, and content not created by a news agency, magazine, blog, or other online publication.

**Video Embeds**
If using YouTube videos as source references, do not include more than twelve (12) on a single page.
Video embeds should be placed after the second paragraph of text.

**Image Embeds**
Keep to the same requirements from the [Beautiful image](#beautiful-image) section, but the height of images is no longer limited to a maximum of 480 pixels.

Images in addition to the leading image shouldn't be placed before the second paragraph of text.

A gallery of images should be separated by `<hr />` html tags.

###Commentary

Commentary can take the form of a critical analysis of the source, a level-headed praise, a question about its intent, a justification of its importance, etc. It’s the chance for the writer to show why the piece is worth posting on the Airspace, and orient the reader’s position on what she is reading.

The commentary of the piece should answer the following questions:

* Does this need to be said?
* Does this need to be said now?
* Does this need to be said by me?

Justify your reasoning for sharing this story with your readers.

###Attribution

All ticker pieces end with attribution to their source or sources

**When using sources, ask:**
* Is this the most original form of the content I’m trying to reference;
* Does the source cite more authentic sources in its text;
* Is this source credible? Do I need to look to a second source to confirm my statements;
* Are there specific biases to this source and how can I address them with my commentary; 
* And is using this source going to assist the reader or confuse them?
  
**Important data to gather from the source:**
* Publication name;
* Article name;
* Writer name;
* And link to best form of article (if linking to a multi-page piece, make sure to use the “single page view” link)  

You don’t always need to include all the above information, but having it is essential.

When dealing with a piece that’s mostly news, or raw content (such as a video clip or song found independently of a media outlet) only the publication name and link are needed.

Example

> *Publication Name*

If you are quoting someone’s direct opinion, you must include Article Name, Writer Name, Publication Name and link.

Example

> “Article Name,” Writer Name, *Publication Name*

Example in HTML

`<a href=”http://link_here/”> “Article Name,” Writer Name, <em>Publication Name</em></a>`

All links go into the Attribution format which is always set up the same way. [include image attributions]
