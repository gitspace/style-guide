<a name="general-notes" class="anchor" href="#general-notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General Notes</h2>

<p>Articles written for publication on The Airspace use a conversational tone, though not at the cost of clarity or correctness. Experts require neither excessive formality nor excessive casualness to express their authority. If you write with The Airspaces’s readership in mind and sound like yourself, you’re most of the way there already.</p>

<h3>
<a name="concise-articles-with-snappy-intros" class="anchor" href="#concise-articles-with-snappy-intros"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Concise articles with snappy intros</h3>

<p>All articles are published on a single page. There is no room for meandering, no space for encyclopedic completeness. Knowing what not to write is even more important than knowing what <em>to</em> write. State your ideas clearly. Don’t warm up to your subject by preceding it with generalizations. You don’t need to tell our readers that Tim Berners-Lee invented the web before getting to your point.</p>

<h3>
<a name="keep-your-readers-in-mind" class="anchor" href="#keep-your-readers-in-mind"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Keep your readers in mind</h3>

<p>Never underestimate your readers' intelligence, but don't overestimate their knowledge. It's your job to tell a story people might know nothing about. If you include the appropriate knowledge, trust your reader has the intelligence follow your more complex thoughts. If you dumb down your article, you will offend your readers. Our readers come from many backgrounds—a reader who knows the minutia of constitutional law might not necessarily have heard of quantum annealing—so take time to define your terms and provide pertinent background information, if only as a link.</p>

<h3>
<a name="on-metaphors" class="anchor" href="#on-metaphors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>On metaphors</h3>

<p>Extended metaphors can provide gentle uplift and support, but they make poor lifeboats. Avoid taking them to an extreme unless you can carry it off in a truly novel and delightful way (no pressure). They may be apt, but are without question overworked.</p>

<h3>
<a name="clarity-first" class="anchor" href="#clarity-first"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Clarity first</h3>

<p>Avoid unnecessary jargon, trendy constructions, vagueness, and buzzwords. Omit needless words. Make sure that pronouns point the way to their referents like the tidy signposts they are. If the antecedent can't easily be found, rewrite the sentence. Strive for brisk pacing and precise explanation. Limit the use of opaque idioms and pop culture references to non-essential points; no reader should need to be familiar with a particular song or movie to understand your central argument. Making references is like winking to your reader (in a non-creepy way)—It should make them feel special, but it shouldn't get in the way of your point.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="images" class="anchor" href="#images"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Images</h2>

<p>As a rule, all images should be <em>at least</em> 640 px wide. This is the standard width of an article. If images are less than 640 px wide, your article will not look beautiful (and we really want beautiful articles). </p>

<p>If your image is over 640 px, great. It can be sized appropriately and optimized for efficient storage and stunning clarity. </p>

<p>Skitch is an essential tool for resizing images, quick edits, and screen captures. (<a href="http://www.oldapps.com/mac/skitch_for_mac.php?old_skitch=10010">Download</a>)</p>

<p>PNG, GIF, and JPEG are all acceptable submission formats. GIF or PNG are preferred for images in which text features prominently. (Don’t use JPEG for pictures with logos, a screenshot of a web page, etc.) </p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="author-bios" class="anchor" href="#author-bios"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Author Bios</h2>

<p>Author bios should be 45 to 70 words long and may include links. They should be snappy, informative, and brief.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eric Harsh is a third year Industrial Design student at the University of Cincinnati and an avid beard enthusiast. In Cincinnati he spends the majority of his time in studio drawing toasters until his eyes bleed. When not working on  projects, he enjoys playing guitar and violin, and staring wistfully out windows thinking of the past. You don’t want to see his twitter. It’s…dark. (65 words)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Author photos don’t need to be professional portraits, but should look polished. A designer will prepare them for publication, so please send them to your editor as an un-tweaked file with a minimum size of 400px by 400px.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="house-style" class="anchor" href="#house-style"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>House Style</h2>

<p>In general, we use U.S. English according to the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>, with <em>Garner’s Modern American Usage</em> taking over in tricky situations.</p>

<h3>
<a name="article-titles-headlines-and-subheads" class="anchor" href="#article-titles-headlines-and-subheads"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ARTICLE TITLES, HEADLINES, and SUBHEADS</h3>

<p>Title case article titles (each major word is uppercase). 
Sentence case article headings (only the initial word is uppercase). 
Neither take terminal punctuation unless a question mark is required. 
Article titles do not take the serial comma and use the ampersand in place of “and.” Article headings do take the serial comma and use the word “and.”</p>

<p>Article titles are automatically set as <code>h1</code>. Subheads are <code>h3</code> or <code>h4</code> as needed. Most article headings are conceptually and rhetorically at the same level as each other; avoid unnecessary complexity and mark them up as <code>h3</code> unless they’re sub-subheads.</p>

<p>Article title or document title</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fat, Loud &amp; Overbearing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Article header or subhead</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fat, loud, and overbearing</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>
<a name="capitalization-for-titles-and-headings" class="anchor" href="#capitalization-for-titles-and-headings"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Capitalization for titles and headings</h4>

<p>When using title case, capitalize the first, last, and all other major words. 
Lowercase “and,” “but,” “for,” “or,” and “nor” unless they are emphasized in a particular heading.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A New Hope for Embedded Fonts</p>

<p>Arguments For and Against FIR Strike Back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a headline-style heading includes a hyphenated phrase, always capitalize the first element. 
Capitalize the second element unless it is an article, preposition, or any of the coordinating conjunctions noted above. 
Exception: if the first element is a prefix like pre-, post-, or anti-, or if the phrase is a written-out number, do not capitalize the second element.</p>

<h3>
<a name="lists" class="anchor" href="#lists"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LISTS</h3>

<ul>
<li>If any item in a list (ordered or not) forms a complete sentence, all items must begin with a capital letter and end with a terminal punctuation mark.</li>
<li>If no items in an unordered list form a complete sentence, skip the capitalization and terminal punctuation.</li>
<li>If the items in the list complete an unfinished introductory sentence, end all but the last item with a semicolon, add an “and” before the final item, and finish off with terminal punctuation.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="linking" class="anchor" href="#linking"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LINKING</h3>

<p>Choose link text that concisely indicates the nature of the linked document. Do not link terminal punctuation. Prefer shorter links to long ones.</p>

<h4>
<a name="title-attribute-text" class="anchor" href="#title-attribute-text"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Title-attribute text</h4>

<p>You may attach title text to links to convey additional information. Many web browsers display this information when the user’s cursor hovers over a link. A useful title attribute for an outbound link might read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The results of Steve Chowders’s 2004 study on brain trauma.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Title-attribute text uses sentence-casing.</p>

<h4>
<a name="alt-attribute-text-images" class="anchor" href="#alt-attribute-text-images"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alt-attribute text (Images)</h4>

<p>Accompany each illustrative image with alt-attribute text that concisely describes the image for those who cannot see it.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Good</strong>: Illustration of Vladimir Putin riding a donkey.</p>

<p><strong>Bad</strong>: Cartoon image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alt-attribute text uses sentence-casing.</p>

<h3>
<a name="punctuation" class="anchor" href="#punctuation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PUNCTUATION</h3>

<p><strong>The ampersand</strong>: Avoid the use of the ampersand except in article and page titles.</p>

<p><strong>Citations</strong>: The titles of books and other major works as well as the titles of magazines and newspapers are marked up with the <code>cite</code> or <code>em</code> element for italic emphasis. The titles of articles and other short works are enclosed in quotation marks.</p>

<p><strong>Commas</strong>: Use the serial comma (the comma preceding the “and” before the last element in a list) except in headlines.</p>

<p><strong>Company and publication names</strong>: Capitalize the names of companies according to each company’s preference unless they begin a sentence, in which case they must be capitalized. Do not capitalize or otherwise emphasize the definite article before the name of a publication—even the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Em dashes</strong>: Do not leave a space on either side of the em dash. Use the en dash for enumerated date ranges (e.g. 1400–1800).</p>

<p><strong>Hyphens</strong>: Hyphenate compound noun phrases used as adjectives unless the noun phrase is so popularly used that hyphenation appears awkward. Do not hyphenate compound adjectival phrases whose first element is an adverb.</p>

<p><strong>Quotations</strong>: Position punctuation according to Chicago rules (periods and commas go on the inside, etc.). Use block quotes for more substantial quotations. Use the correct (“curly”) symbols, not a double prime. </p>

<p><strong>Single Quote Mark</strong>: As nice as they are, single quotation marks are not used except to demarcate quotations within quotations and in place of double quotation marks or italics in an article title.</p>

<hr><h1>
<a name="commentary-ticker-guide" class="anchor" href="#commentary-ticker-guide"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Commentary Ticker Guide</h1>

<p>The Airspace uniquely separates our content into the <strong>commentary ticker</strong> and the <strong>main loop</strong>. The commentary ticker (or just ticker) is analogous to the ticker tape that would constantly report the latest stock prices or news reports. Because of the Airspace's limited staff and resources, we will never be the forefront of news, but that doesn't mean we can't share the news with our readers in a essentially Airspace way.</p>

<p>The point of the ticker is to provide the readership with engaging or important content we have found elsewhere in publishing. To make this content unique to The Airspace, short commentary is added to a ticker post placing an important spin on the story.</p>

<p>Ticker content is selected by the individuals writing the posts but should overlap with the higher concepts The Airspace is aimed at: culture, technology, scholarship.</p>

<p>Ticker posts, due to their nature of referencing others’ work, should be kept short. This means they are only long enough to comprehensively cover the topic from a specific angle and not any longer. If you find yourself citing more than three sources, it might be better to convert the piece into a <strong>main loop piece</strong>.</p>

<p>This style guide discusses the anatomy of a ticker article.</p>

</ol><hr><h3>
<a name="magnetic-headline" class="anchor" href="#magnetic-headline"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Magnetic headline</h3>

<p>Your headline is the first, and perhaps only, impression you make on a prospective reader. Without a compelling promise that turns a browser into a reader, the rest of your words may as well not even exist.</p>

<p>On average, for every ten people that encounter your article, eight will read the headline, and two will read the rest of the article. Every sentence exists to move the story forward and propel the reader into the next sentence. This is what compels people to finish articles. The headline is the very first sentence, if it can't move a reader into the body of the article, it needs to be rewritten.</p>

<p>Every great story has an incredible headline it deserves. It's your responsibility as a writer to find that headline, even if it takes a great deal of time and requires you to throw out multiple bad headlines first.</p>

<h4>
<a name="verb--colon-construction" class="anchor" href="#verb--colon-construction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Verb + colon construction</h4>

<p>If the source is a video, or audio selection, it is appropriate to use Verb + Colon construction. This means starting the headline with “Watch:” or “Listen:” or “Play:” This indicates to the reader that there is a video, audio selection, or game inside. These constructions are not mandated for this type of content, a typical headline can suffice. If you wish to include these cues, the Verb+Colon format must be used.</p>

<hr><h3>
<a name="beautiful-image" class="anchor" href="#beautiful-image"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beautiful image</h3>

<p>All articles on the Airspace start with an image. This image must encompass the essence of the story and the nature of both the source and the individual commentary. </p>

<p>Don't settle for stock photos or contrived promotional material. Dig deep to find a great image. In most places the article is shared, the image or a thumbnail of it will be positioned next to the headline. It is another essential lure to bring readers into the story.</p>

<p><strong>Technical details for the leading image</strong>
It must be 640 pixels wide, and between 480 and 270 pixels in height. This maintains a minimum aspect ratio of 1.33, and a maximum of 2.4. This range is most comfortable on the human eye and fits best into The Airspace layout.</p>

<p><strong>All images:</strong>
Must be compressed .jpeg, .jpg or .png formats no greater than 100 KB.</p>

<p><strong>Image Adjustments:</strong>
If any text is added to an image, it must be in standard Airspace typeface (Ideal Sans by H&amp;FJ, or Gotham by H&amp;FJ) unless otherwise approved by a creative director or editor.</p>

<p><strong>Uploading:</strong>
Image adjustments, sizing, and compression should be completed before uploading to Wordpress. The image you upload should be the exact version you wish to see on the site.</p>

<hr><h3>
<a name="the-lede-rhymes-with-need-not-spelled-lead" class="anchor" href="#the-lede-rhymes-with-need-not-spelled-lead"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Lede (rhymes with "need," not spelled "lead")</h3>

<p>The lede is the most important part of the story, literally. It is the sentence or paragraph (or sometimes series of paragraphs) that contain the most essential information or concept you're trying to share. Don't confuse this with a hook (a sentence designed to draw a reader in) or the subhead (an article summary that works in harmony with the title or headline).</p>

<p>While the lede is the core of the story, it is not the story itself. Every sentence should move the story forward and have a clear relationship to the lede.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lede doesn't actually lead off the article. This is called "burying the lede" and it's not always a bad thing. </p>

<hr><h3>
<a name="references" class="anchor" href="#references"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>References</h3>

<p>Ticker articles are based of the journalistic work of others. To establish the credibility and authority of your commentary you must respect that original work. The best way to do this is through references, quotes, and citation. </p>

<p>References can take many forms. It can be a block quote from the text of an article, it can be a video, it can be a song, or it can be a series of images. </p>

<p><strong>Blockquotes</strong>
When using blockquotes, do not quote more than 350 words at a time uninterrupted. If more than 350 words are required, include commentary or narrative between quotes.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the 350 word limit include reprinting the full text of a statement by an individual, and content not created by a news agency, magazine, blog, or other online publication.</p>

<p><strong>Video Embeds</strong>
If using YouTube videos as source references, do not include more than twelve (12) on a single page.
Video embeds should be placed after the second paragraph of text.</p>

<p><strong>Image Embeds</strong>
Keep to the same requirements from the <a href="#beautiful-image">Beautiful image</a> section, but the height of images is no longer limited to a maximum of 480 pixels.</p>

<p>Images in addition to the leading image shouldn't be placed before the second paragraph of text.</p>

<p>A gallery of images should be separated by <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code> html tags.</p>

<hr><h3>
<a name="commentary" class="anchor" href="#commentary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Commentary</h3>

<p>Commentary can take the form of a critical analysis of the source, a level-headed praise, a question about its intent, a justification of its importance, etc. It’s the chance for the writer to show why the piece is worth posting on the Airspace, and orient the reader’s position on what she is reading.</p>

<p>The commentary of the piece should answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this need to be said?</li>
<li>Does this need to be said now?</li>
<li>Does this need to be said by me?</li>
</ul><p>Justify your reasoning for sharing this story with your readers. </p>

<hr><h3>
<a name="attribution" class="anchor" href="#attribution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attribution</h3>

<p>All ticker pieces end with attribution to their source or sources</p>

<p><strong>When using sources, ask:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is this the most original form of the content I’m trying to reference;</li>
<li>Does the source cite more authentic sources in its text;</li>
<li>Is this source credible? Do I need to look to a second source to confirm my statements;</li>
<li>Are there specific biases to this source and how can I address them with my commentary; </li>
<li>And is using this source going to assist the reader or confuse them?</li>
</ul><p><strong>Important data to gather from the source:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Publication name;</li>
<li>Article name;</li>
<li>Writer name;</li>
<li>And link to best form of article (if linking to a multi-page piece, make sure to use the “single page view” link)<br>
</li>
</ul><p>You don’t always need to include all the above information, but having it is essential.</p>

<p>When dealing with a piece that’s mostly news, or raw content (such as a video clip or song found independently of a media outlet) only the publication name and link are needed.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Publication Name</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are quoting someone’s direct opinion, you must include Article Name, Writer Name, Publication Name and link.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Article Name,” Writer Name, <em>Publication Name</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example in HTML</p>

<p><code>&lt;a href=”http://link_here/”&gt; “Article Name,” Writer Name, &lt;em&gt;Publication Name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>

<p>All links go into the Attribution format which is always set up the same way. [include image attributions]</p>

<p>HTML formatting</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;a href=”http://Link1_Goes_Here/” &gt;”Article Name,” Writer Name, &lt;em&gt;Publication Name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=”http://Link2_Goes_Here/” &gt;”Article Name,” Writer Name, &lt;em&gt;Publication Name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=”http://Link3_Goes_Here/” &gt;”Article Name,” Writer Name, &lt;em&gt;Publication Name&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
