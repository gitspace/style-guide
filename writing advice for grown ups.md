##Writing Advice for Hardcore MOFOs

Assuming you know how to arrange words to make sentences, these are the points you should keep in mind. They're in some kind of order, but I'm not sure what kind. It was originally a 27 point list, but I seperated it into four sections of five, and one section of seven for easy mental digestion.

* All of these rules apply *most of the time*. Being a good writer is what allows you to know when to break the rules.
* Your article needs to make an argument. It can't just describe what something else says.
* Your argument needs to be coherent and more or less linear. Clearly mark parentheticals of any time, and relegate them to footnotes if possible. Don't interrupt yourself. If something seems like it might be an interruption, it probably is.
* Your introduction should serve as "argumentative titillation." Over the course of one or more paragraphs, you should establish a set of questions or problems your article will deal with.
* Make your article narratively interesting. Your article tells a story; though the story is likely logical it nonetheless benefits from thinking about surprise, drama, and suspense.

* Your introduction establishes a set of expectations for the reader, and those expectations arise from the implicit promises you make them. So don't forget to make some promises, and make them carefully. Then when you've finished your entire article, go back and compare your promises to what you wrote.
* Just like a paragraph is a unit in which one idea is measured, so is a sentence. Don't use semicolons to separate ideas; use them to separate the same idea divided in two sentences (cf. this sentence).
* Paragraphs should be ordered in a way that makes sense. In general move from simple to complex, description to analysis, etc.
* Balance the relationship between different levels of analysis: trees should be inside forests, forests inside broader topographies, and so on. The entire structuration of a paragraph or a paper is *fractal*: you need to close out paragraphs just as you close out sections just as you close out the entire paper. 
* Your conclusion out to answer the question: If everything in the essay is true, what should the reader learn from it all? That may require gesturing towards an area of thought broader than the topic of your article to that point.

* Almost never leave a quote hanging. Generally speaking, if you quote something, analyze it. You should pull meaning from the material you reference. And if you can't find a way to analyze it and connect it to your article, you probably don't need to quote it.
* Generally (again), quoting requires four moves: introduction (where you explain where the quote is coming from), the quotation itself, an explanation of its significance, and an analysis that shows why it's relevant to your argument.
* After blockquotes, always cleverly summarize in a way that keeps the reader from knowing you're summarizing. Not easy to do. But most readers skip block quotes.
* If you feel like you're not saying anything, that's probably because you're not thinking closely enough. If you feel like you have nothing to say, it's probably because you're moving too fast.
* You should be able to go through your article and write out, in a sentence, the answers to the following questions for every sentence and paragraph: "What is this sentence doing in my argument? What is it communicating to the reader" and "What is this paragraph doing in my argument? What is it communicating to the reader?" This is *not* the same as asking "What is this paragraph/sentence saying?"

---

* Slow the hell down. Almost everyone writes too fast.
* Remember you are writing for a reader (not for an editor or for yourself). Communicating to your reader properly can be more important than your ideas.
* Ideas are not the causes of writing, but rather its effects.
* About rhythm: vary your sentence length throughout paragraphs. Use short sentences (when you mean to), and use long sentences (when you mean to). Don't be afraid of semicolons and colons, but value a good strong period. Colons are generally awesome.
* Likewise: sentences should communicate meaning through sound. Your final sentence should sound conclusion-y; your transitional sentences should sound transition-y; sentences that undo or invert ideas should sound like they're doing that. 

---

* Don't be afraid to try for spectacularity occasionally, whether in rhythm, diction, syntax, paragraph structure, argumentative structure, etc.
* Avoid "to be" and all of its forms as much as you can; get rid of passives when you can. In general, develop a broad vocabulary of verbs and sentence structures. If you find yourself using certain kinds as a crutch, go look for other ways to say things in different texts.
* Your article will generally get better as you write. That means, effectively, you're smarter at the end of the article than at the beginning. In turn, you ought to go back and rewrite the beginning so it's as smart as the end.
* A corollary: all your sentences should *know* about all your other sentences. Though the reader reads the article diachronically, you write it synchronically. That means you have the advantage of establishing narrative effects in advance of their outcomes, and you ought to manipulate rhythm in a similar way.
* One good way to write a great article is to create a first draft, go through it and pick out the three or four really good ideas, throw everything else out, and start over.
* To learn how to write better, read writers you admire and pay attention to their style (not their content). Then copy their style and make it your own.
* Don't make long lists.
