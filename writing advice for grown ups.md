##Writing Advice for Grown Ups

Assuming you know how to arrange words to make sentences, these are the points you should keep in mind. They're in some kind of order, but I'm not sure what kind.

1. All of these rules apply *most of the time*. Being a goof writer is what allows you to know when to break the rules.
2. Your article needs to make an argument. It can't just describe what something else says.
3. Your argument needs to be coherent and more or less linear. Clearly mark parentheticals of any time, and relegate them to footnotes if possible. Don't interrupt yourself. If something seems like it might be an interruption, it probably is.
4. Your introduction should serve as "argumentative titilation." Over the course of one or more paragraphs, you should establish a set of questions or problems your article will deal with.
5. Make your article narratively interesting. Your article tells a story; though the story is likely logical it nonetheless benefits from thinking about surprise, drama, and suspense.
6. Your introduction establishes a set of expectations for the reader, and those expectations arise from the implicit promises you make them. So don't forget to make some promises, and make them carefully. Then when you've finished your entire article, go back and compare your promises to what you wrote.
7. Just like a paragraph is a unit in which one idea is measured, so is a sentence. Don't use semicolons to seperate ideas; use them to seperate the same idea divided in two sentences (cf. this sentence).
8. Paragraphs should be ordered in a way that makes sense. In general move from simple to complex, description to analysis, etc.
9. Balance the relationship between different levels of analysis: trees should be inside forests, forests inside broader topographies, and so on. The entire structuration of a paragraph or a paper is *fractal*: you need to close out paragraphs just as you close out sections just as you close out the entire paper. 
10. Your conclusion out to answer the question: If everything in the essay is true, what should the reader learn from it all? That may require gesturing towards an area of thought broader than the topic of your article to that point.
