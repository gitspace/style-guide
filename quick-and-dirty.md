##Quick and Dirty Guide to Airspace Style

1. Use the serial (Oxford) comma. It's not "red, white and blue"; it's "red, white, and blue."
2. Keep your commas and periods inside quotation marks. Semi-colons, and colons go outside the marks. Question marks go inside or outside depending on whether they belong to the quote or the greater sentence. See point 1 for an example.
3. If you have a singular possessive that ends in an s, you still use apostrophe-s ('s) to show possession. "Texas's beaches," not "Texas' beaches."
4. Do not capitalize "internet." It is not a proper place.
