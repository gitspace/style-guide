##General Notes

Articles written for publication on The Airspace use a conversational tone, though not at the cost of clarity or correctness. Experts require neither excessive formality nor excessive casualness to express their authority. If you write with The Airspaces’s readership in mind and sound like yourself, you’re most of the way there already.

###Concise articles with snappy intros
All articles are published on a single page. There is no room for meandering, no space for encyclopedic completeness. Knowing what not to write is even more important than knowing what *to* write. State your ideas clearly. Don’t warm up to your subject by preceding it with generalizations. You don’t need to tell our readers that Tim Berners-Lee invented the web before getting to your point.

###Keep your readers in mind
Never underestimate your readers' intelligence, but don't overestimate their knowledge. It's your job to tell a story people might know nothing about. If you include the appropriate knowledge, trust your reader has the intelligence follow your more complex thoughts. If you dumb down your article, you will offend your readers. Our readers come from many backgrounds—a reader who knows the minutia of constitutional law might not necessarily have heard of quantum annealing—so take time to define your terms and provide pertinent background information, if only as a link.

###On metaphors
Extended metaphors can provide gentle uplift and support, but they make poor lifeboats. Avoid taking them to an extreme unless you can carry it off in a truly novel and delightful way (no pressure). They may be apt, but are without question overworked.

###Clarity first
Avoid unnecessary jargon, trendy constructions, vagueness, and buzzwords. Omit needless words. Make sure that pronouns point the way to their referents like the tidy signposts they are. If the antecedent can't easily be found, rewrite the sentence. Strive for brisk pacing and precise explanation. Limit the use of opaque idioms and pop culture references to non-essential points; no reader should need to be familiar with a particular song or movie to understand your central argument. Making references is like winking to your reader (in a non-creepy way)—It should make them feel special, but it shouldn't get in the way of your point.

---
##Images

As a rule, all images should be *at least* 640 px wide. This is the standard width of an article. If images are less than 640 px wide, your article will not look beautiful (and we really want beautiful articles). 

If your image is over 640 px, great. It can be sized appropriately and optimized for efficient storage and stunning clarity. 

Skitch is an essential tool for resizing images, quick edits, and screen captures. ([Download](http://www.oldapps.com/mac/skitch_for_mac.php?old_skitch=10010))

PNG, GIF, and JPEG are all acceptable submission formats. GIF or PNG are preferred for images in which text features prominently. (Don’t use JPEG for pictures with logos, a screenshot of a web page, etc.) 

---

##Author Bios

Author bios should be 45 to 70 words long and may include links. They should be snappy, informative, and brief.

Example:

> Eric Harsh is a third year Industrial Design student at the University of Cincinnati and an avid beard enthusiast. In Cincinnati he spends the majority of his time in studio drawing toasters until his eyes bleed. When not working on  projects, he enjoys playing guitar and violin, and staring wistfully out windows thinking of the past. You don’t want to see his twitter. It’s…dark. (65 words)

Author photos don’t need to be professional portraits, but should look polished. A designer will prepare them for publication, so please send them to your editor as an un-tweaked file with a minimum size of 400px by 400px.

---
##House Style

In general, we use U.S. English according to the *Chicago Manual of Style*, with *Garner’s Modern American Usage* taking over in tricky situations.

###ARTICLE TITLES, HEADLINES, and SUBHEADS
Title case article titles (each major word is uppercase). 
Sentence case article headings (only the initial word is uppercase). 
Neither take terminal punctuation unless a question mark is required. 
Article titles do not take the serial comma and use the ampersand in place of “and.” Article headings do take the serial comma and use the word “and.”

Article titles are automatically set as `h1`. Subheads are `h3` or `h4` as needed. Most article headings are conceptually and rhetorically at the same level as each other; avoid unnecessary complexity and mark them up as `h3` unless they’re sub-subheads.

Article title or document title

> Fat, Loud & Overbearing

Article header or subhead

> Fat, loud, and overbearing

####Capitalization for titles and headings

When using title case, capitalize the first, last, and all other major words. 
Lowercase “and,” “but,” “for,” “or,” and “nor” unless they are emphasized in a particular heading.

Examples:

> A New Hope for Embedded Fonts

> Arguments For and Against FIR Strike Back

When a headline-style heading includes a hyphenated phrase, always capitalize the first element. 
Capitalize the second element unless it is an article, preposition, or any of the coordinating conjunctions noted above. 
Exception: if the first element is a prefix like pre-, post-, or anti-, or if the phrase is a written-out number, do not capitalize the second element.

###LISTS

* If any item in a list (ordered or not) forms a complete sentence, all items must begin with a capital letter and end with a terminal punctuation mark.
* If no items in an unordered list form a complete sentence, skip the capitalization and terminal punctuation.
* If the items in the list complete an unfinished introductory sentence, end all but the last item with a semicolon, add an “and” before the final item, and finish off with terminal punctuation.

###LINKING

Choose link text that concisely indicates the nature of the linked document. Do not link terminal punctuation. Prefer shorter links to long ones.

####Title-attribute text

You may attach title text to links to convey additional information. Many web browsers display this information when the user’s cursor hovers over a link. A useful title attribute for an outbound link might read:

> The results of Steve Chowders’s 2004 study on brain trauma.

Title-attribute text uses sentence-casing.

####Alt-attribute text (Images)

Accompany each illustrative image with alt-attribute text that concisely describes the image for those who cannot see it.

Examples:

> **Good**: Illustration of Vladimir Putin riding a donkey.

> **Bad**: Cartoon image.

Alt-attribute text uses sentence-casing.

###PUNCTUATION

**The ampersand**: Avoid the use of the ampersand except in article and page titles.

**Citations**: The titles of books and other major works as well as the titles of magazines and newspapers are marked up with the `cite` or `em` element for italic emphasis. The titles of articles and other short works are enclosed in quotation marks.

**Commas**: Use the serial comma (the comma preceding the “and” before the last element in a list) except in headlines.

**Company and publication names**: Capitalize the names of companies according to each company’s preference unless they begin a sentence, in which case they must be capitalized. Do not capitalize or otherwise emphasize the definite article before the name of a publication—even the *New York Times*.

**Em dashes**: Do not leave a space on either side of the em dash. Use the en dash for enumerated date ranges (e.g. 1400–1800).

**Hyphens**: Hyphenate compound noun phrases used as adjectives unless the noun phrase is so popularly used that hyphenation appears awkward. Do not hyphenate compound adjectival phrases whose first element is an adverb.

**Quotations**: Position punctuation according to Chicago rules (periods and commas go on the inside, etc.). Use block quotes for more substantial quotations. Use the correct (“curly”) symbols, not a double prime. 

**Single Quote Mark**: As nice as they are, single quotation marks are not used except to demarcate quotations within quotations and in place of double quotation marks or italics in an article title.

#Commentary Ticker Guide



The Airspace uniquely separates our content into the **commentary ticker** and the **main loop**. The commentary ticker (or just ticker) is analogous to the ticker tape that would constantly report the latest stock prices or news reports. Because of the Airspace's limited staff and resources, we will never be the forefront of news, but that doesn't mean we can't share the news with our readers in a essentially Airspace way.

The point of the ticker is to provide the readership with engaging or important content we have found elsewhere in publishing. To make this content unique to The Airspace, short commentary is added to a ticker post placing an important spin on the story.

Ticker content is selected by the individuals writing the posts but should overlap with the higher concepts The Airspace is aimed at: culture, technology, scholarship.

Ticker posts, due to their nature of referencing others’ work, should be kept short. This means they are only long enough to comprehensively cover the topic from a specific angle and not any longer. If you find yourself citing more than three sources, it might be better to convert the piece into a **main loop piece**.

This style guide discusses the anatomy of a ticker article.

###The Outline of a Ticker
1. [Magnetic headline](#magnetic-headline)
2. [Beautiful image](#beautiful-image)
3. [The Lede](#the-lede-rhymes-with-need-not-spelled-lead)
4. [References](#references)
5. [Commentary](#commentary)
6. [Attribution](#attribution)

--------

###Magnetic headline

Your headline is the first, and perhaps only, impression you make on a prospective reader. Without a compelling promise that turns a browser into a reader, the rest of your words may as well not even exist.

On average, for every ten people that encounter your article, eight will read the headline, and two will read the rest of the article. Every sentence exists to move the story forward and propel the reader into the next sentence. This is what compels people to finish articles. The headline is the very first sentence, if it can't move a reader into the body of the article, it needs to be rewritten.

Every great story has an incredible headline it deserves. It's your responsibility as a writer to find that headline, even if it takes a great deal of time and requires you to throw out multiple bad headlines first.

####Verb + colon construction

If the source is a video, or audio selection, it is appropriate to use Verb + Colon construction. This means starting the headline with “Watch:” or “Listen:” or “Play:” This indicates to the reader that there is a video, audio selection, or game inside. These constructions are not mandated for this type of content, a typical headline can suffice. If you wish to include these cues, the Verb+Colon format must be used.

---------

###Beautiful image

All articles on the Airspace start with an image. This image must encompass the essence of the story and the nature of both the source and the individual commentary. 

Don't settle for stock photos or contrived promotional material. Dig deep to find a great image. In most places the article is shared, the image or a thumbnail of it will be positioned next to the headline. It is another essential lure to bring readers into the story.

**Technical details for the leading image**
It must be 640 pixels wide, and between 480 and 270 pixels in height. This maintains a minimum aspect ratio of 1.33, and a maximum of 2.4. This range is most comfortable on the human eye and fits best into The Airspace layout.

**All images:**
Must be compressed .jpeg, .jpg or .png formats no greater than 100 KB.

**Image Adjustments:**
If any text is added to an image, it must be in standard Airspace typeface (Ideal Sans by H&FJ, or Gotham by H&FJ) unless otherwise approved by a creative director or editor.

**Uploading:**
Image adjustments, sizing, and compression should be completed before uploading to Wordpress. The image you upload should be the exact version you wish to see on the site.

--------

###The Lede (rhymes with "need," not spelled "lead")

The lede is the most important part of the story, literally. It is the sentence or paragraph* (or sometimes series of paragraphs) that contain the most essential information or concept you're trying to share. Don't confuse this with a hook (a sentence designed to draw a reader in) or the subhead (an article summary that works in harmony with the title or headline).

While the lede is the core of the story, it is not the story itself. Every sentence should move the story forward and have a clear relationship to the lede.

Sometimes the lede doesn't actually lead off the article. This is called "burying the lede" and it's not always a bad thing. 

*Here the concept of a lede and nut graph (nutshell paragraph) are combined togehter. They serve the same purpose through different forms.

-------

###References

Ticker articles are based of the journalistic work of others. To establish the credibility and authority of your commentary you must respect that original work. The best way to do this is through references, quotes, and citation. 

References can take many forms. It can be a block quote from the text of an article, it can be a video, it can be a song, or it can be a series of images. 

**Blockquotes**
When using blockquotes, do not quote more than 350 words at a time uninterrupted. If more than 350 words are required, include commentary or narrative between quotes.

Exceptions to the 350 word limit include reprinting the full text of a statement by an individual, and content not created by a news agency, magazine, blog, or other online publication.

**Video Embeds**
If using YouTube videos as source references, do not include more than twelve (12) on a single page.
Video embeds should be placed after the second paragraph of text.

**Image Embeds**
Keep to the same requirements from the [Beautiful image](#beautiful-image) section, but the height of images is no longer limited to a maximum of 480 pixels.

Images in addition to the leading image shouldn't be placed before the second paragraph of text.

A gallery of images should be separated by `<hr />` html tags.

---

###Commentary

Commentary can take the form of a critical analysis of the source, a level-headed praise, a question about its intent, a justification of its importance, etc. It’s the chance for the writer to show why the piece is worth posting on the Airspace, and orient the reader’s position on what she is reading.

The commentary of the piece should answer the following questions:

* Does this need to be said?
* Does this need to be said now?
* Does this need to be said by me?

Justify your reasoning for sharing this story with your readers. 

-------

###Attribution

All ticker pieces end with attribution to their source or sources

**When using sources, ask:**
* Is this the most original form of the content I’m trying to reference;
* Does the source cite more authentic sources in its text;
* Is this source credible? Do I need to look to a second source to confirm my statements;
* Are there specific biases to this source and how can I address them with my commentary; 
* And is using this source going to assist the reader or confuse them?
  
**Important data to gather from the source:**
* Publication name;
* Article name;
* Writer name;
* And link to best form of article (if linking to a multi-page piece, make sure to use the “single page view” link)  

You don’t always need to include all the above information, but having it is essential.

When dealing with a piece that’s mostly news, or raw content (such as a video clip or song found independently of a media outlet) only the publication name and link are needed.

Example

> *Publication Name*

If you are quoting someone’s direct opinion, you must include Article Name, Writer Name, Publication Name and link.

Example

> “Article Name,” Writer Name, *Publication Name*

Example in HTML

`<a href=”http://link_here/”> “Article Name,” Writer Name, <em>Publication Name</em></a>`

All links go into the Attribution format which is always set up the same way. [include image attributions]

HTML formatting

    <hr />
    <h4><em>Attribution</em></h4>
    <a href=”http://Link1_Goes_Here/” >”Article Name,” Writer Name, <em>Publication Name</em></a>
    <a href=”http://Link2_Goes_Here/” >”Article Name,” Writer Name, <em>Publication Name</em></a>
    <a href=”http://Link3_Goes_Here/” >”Article Name,” Writer Name, <em>Publication Name</em></a>

#Universal Writing Tips

These elementary ideas apply to almost all types of writtng.

1. Try to avoid overusing forms of "to be." Verbs like is, are, was, were, etc. tend to make writing passive. Action verbs are more engaging. Never use the passive voice when you can use the active. "The man was bitten by the dog," (passive) is longer and less forceful than "The dog bit the man." (Active).

2. Don't use the word "one" when you really mean "people." It's an archaic approach to formality. Try rewriting the sentence so neither "one" nor "people" is needed for it to make sense.

3. Not only is parallel structure helpful for readers, it's wrong to break from it. When making lists keep all levels of the list in the same tense, structure or verb form. This applies to words and phrases, and clauses. 
> Rick likes hiking, swimming, and riding a bicycle.
> Rick works quickly, accurately, and thoroughly.
> Rick told his grandma she should get a lot of sleep,not eat too much, and do warm up excercises before her cage match.

4. Try to avoid Who, That, and Which. They usually are not needed. Make an effort to scan your writing for "that" and remove them when making revisions. It hardly ever makes a difference. But, if you have to use them, know "Who" refers to people while "that" and "which" refer to groups of things. "That" introduces essential clauses. If you were to remove the clause following "that" the sentence would no longer make sense. "Which" introduces non-essential clauses. If you remove the clause following "which," the sentence still makes sense. 

5. Avoid overly complex words when simple ones function just the same. For example: don't use "usage" or "utilize" when you mean to say "use." Long words on their own don't make a writer appear intelligent. They must be used sparingly and skillfully. Save the ten-dollar word for the right moment.

6. Effect and affect are different words. Effect is normally a noun describing the consequence of something ocuring "The experiment had three effects…" where "affect" is a verb that means to influence. There is an exception. One can "effect a change." In that situation, effect is used as a verb.

7. Less refers to non-count nouns. Fewer refers to count nouns. 
> Less water, less decency, less sand | Fewer glasses of water, fewer decent people, fewer pails of sand.

8. While sets up a temporal relationship and does not fucntion to contrast to ideas. In those situations, use "whereas" or "although."
> My burrito was burning while I watched the sports match."
> Although Roberto likes Big Bird, I find oversized bird off-putting.

9. Since describes a temporal relationship whereas "because" desribes a casual relationship.
> Since I ate the whole coconut, I have become very ill. 
> Because I've been sick, I've been eating less.

10. Don't put contrast words together (*e.g.* "but rather," "yet although," "but despite"). Pick your favorite of the two.

11. Don't use "this" without a close and easily defineable antecedent. If it's at all unclear, follow this with a noun that specifies the antecedent.
> The looming deconstruction of the solar system caused the pigeon population of Ecuador to migrate to Quebec in order to find shelter before being anhiliated by the solar storms. This *finding* was studied for years to come.

12. Only use multiple qualifiers when they say different things. "brilliant genius," is redundant where "ambivilant genius" is not.

13. If the word "very" appears in your text, rewrite to remove it. Or, just cut it and see if the flow still works. 

14. Try to avoid the adjective forms of "certain" and "specific." "Certian things causes specific consequences" is not a useful sentence as it only establishes a vague relationship.

15. Remove "I believe," "I think," and "I feel," from all writing. As the writer, you are the authority on the topic. Your beliefs, thoughts, and feelings are implied.

16. Random doesn't mean arbitrary

17. Don't say something is interesting. Show how something is interesting so the reader comes to the conclusion on their own terms.

18. Avoid metaphors, similes, or other figures of speech you are accustomed to seeing. Clichés are too comfortable and make it difficult to produce an emotional response. Take the time to create your own images.

19. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out. You want to charge your language with meaning to the utmost degree. Extra words dilute meaning. Less is always better. Except when it's not.

20. Don't use a foreign phrase, scientific word, or bit of jargon if there is a understandable English equivalent. You always want your ideas to be accessible. If a technical word is needed, teach the readers to understand it.

21. Confidence and arrogance in writing are not the same. 

22. Avoid superlatives at all costs. High levels of abstraction are difficult to live up to. Instead show the point a superlative would have made.

#Writing Advice for Hardcore MOFOs

Assuming you know how to arrange words to make sentences, these are the points you should keep in mind. They're in some kind of order, but I'm not sure what kind. It was originally a 27 point list, but I seperated it into four sections of five, and one section of seven for easy mental digestion.

* All of these rules apply *most of the time*. Being a good writer is what allows you to know when to break the rules.
* Your article needs to make an argument. It can't just describe what something else says.
* Your argument needs to be coherent and more or less linear. Clearly mark parentheticals of any time, and relegate them to footnotes if possible. Don't interrupt yourself. If something seems like it might be an interruption, it probably is.
* Your introduction should serve as "argumentative titillation." Over the course of one or more paragraphs, you should establish a set of questions or problems your article will deal with.
* Make your article narratively interesting. Your article tells a story; though the story is likely logical it nonetheless benefits from thinking about surprise, drama, and suspense.

******

* Your introduction establishes a set of expectations for the reader, and those expectations arise from the implicit promises you make them. So don't forget to make some promises, and make them carefully. Then when you've finished your entire article, go back and compare your promises to what you wrote.
* Just like a paragraph is a unit in which one idea is measured, so is a sentence. Don't use semicolons to separate ideas; use them to separate the same idea divided in two sentences (cf. this sentence).
* Paragraphs should be ordered in a way that makes sense. In general move from simple to complex, description to analysis, etc.
* Balance the relationship between different levels of analysis: trees should be inside forests, forests inside broader topographies, and so on. The entire structuration of a paragraph or a paper is *fractal*: you need to close out paragraphs just as you close out sections just as you close out the entire paper. 
* Your conclusion out to answer the question: If everything in the essay is true, what should the reader learn from it all? That may require gesturing towards an area of thought broader than the topic of your article to that point.

******

* Almost never leave a quote hanging. Generally speaking, if you quote something, analyze it. You should pull meaning from the material you reference. And if you can't find a way to analyze it and connect it to your article, you probably don't need to quote it.
* Generally (again), quoting requires four moves: introduction (where you explain where the quote is coming from), the quotation itself, an explanation of its significance, and an analysis that shows why it's relevant to your argument.
* After blockquotes, always cleverly summarize in a way that keeps the reader from knowing you're summarizing. Not easy to do. But most readers skip block quotes.
* If you feel like you're not saying anything, that's probably because you're not thinking closely enough. If you feel like you have nothing to say, it's probably because you're moving too fast.
* You should be able to go through your article and write out, in a sentence, the answers to the following questions for every sentence and paragraph: "What is this sentence doing in my argument? What is it communicating to the reader" and "What is this paragraph doing in my argument? What is it communicating to the reader?" This is *not* the same as asking "What is this paragraph/sentence saying?"

******

* Slow the hell down. Almost everyone writes too fast.
* Remember you are writing for a reader (not for an editor or for yourself). Communicating to your reader properly can be more important than your ideas.
* Ideas are not the causes of writing, but rather its effects.
* About rhythm: vary your sentence length throughout paragraphs. Use short sentences (when you mean to), and use long sentences (when you mean to). Don't be afraid of semicolons and colons, but value a good strong period. Colons are generally awesome.
* Likewise: sentences should communicate meaning through sound. Your final sentence should sound conclusion-y; your transitional sentences should sound transition-y; sentences that undo or invert ideas should sound like they're doing that. 

******

* Don't be afraid to try for spectacularity occasionally, whether in rhythm, diction, syntax, paragraph structure, argumentative structure, etc.
* Avoid "to be" and all of its forms as much as you can; get rid of passives when you can. In general, develop a broad vocabulary of verbs and sentence structures. If you find yourself using certain kinds as a crutch, go look for other ways to say things in different texts.
* Your article will generally get better as you write. That means, effectively, you're smarter at the end of the article than at the beginning. In turn, you ought to go back and rewrite the beginning so it's as smart as the end.
* A corollary: all your sentences should *know* about all your other sentences. Though the reader reads the article diachronically, you write it synchronically. That means you have the advantage of establishing narrative effects in advance of their outcomes, and you ought to manipulate rhythm in a similar way.
* One good way to write a great article is to create a first draft, go through it and pick out the three or four really good ideas, throw everything else out, and start over.
* To learn how to write better, read writers you admire and pay attention to their style (not their content). Then copy their style and make it your own.
* Don't make long lists.
