##General Notes

Articles written for publication on The Airspace use a conversational tone, though not at the cost of clarity or correctness. Experts require neither excessive formality nor excessive casualness to express their authority. If you write with The Airspaces’s readership in mind and sound like yourself, you’re most of the way there already.

###Concise articles with snappy intros
All articles are published on a single page. There is no room for meandering, no space for encyclopedic completeness. Knowing what not to write is even more important than knowing what *to* write. State your ideas clearly. Don’t warm up to your subject by preceding it with generalizations. You don’t need to tell our readers that Tim Berners-Lee invented the web before getting to your point.

###Keep your readers in mind
Never underestimate your readers' intelligence, but don't overestimate their knowledge. It's your job to tell a story people might know nothing about. If you include the appropriate knowledge, trust your reader has the intelligence follow your more complex thoughts. If you dumb down your article, you will offend your readers. Our readers come from many backgrounds—a reader who knows the minutia of constitutional law might not necessarily have heard of quantum annealing—so take time to define your terms and provide pertinent background information, if only as a link.

###On metaphors
Extended metaphors can provide gentle uplift and support, but they make poor lifeboats. Avoid extended cooking and spell-casting metaphors unless you can carry it off in a truly novel and delightful way. They may be apt, but are without question overworked.

###Clarity first
Avoid unnecessary jargon, trendy constructions, vagueness, and buzzwords. Omit needless words. Make sure that pronouns point the way to their referents like the tidy signposts they are. If the antecednet can't easily be found, rewrite the sentence. Strive for brisk pacing and precise explanation. Limit the use of opaque idioms and pop culture references to non-essential points; no reader should need to be familiar with a particular song or movie to understand your central argument. Making references is like winking to your reader (in a non-creepy way)—It should make them feel special, but it shouldn't get in the way of your point.

##Images

As a rule, all images should be *at least* 640 px wide. This is the standard with of an article. If images are less than 640 px wide, your article will not look beautiful (and we really want beautiful articles). 

If your image is over 640 px, great. It can be sized appropriately and optimized for efficient size and stunning clarity. 

Skitch is an essential tool for resizing images, quick edits, and screen captures. ([Download](http://www.oldapps.com/mac/skitch_for_mac.php?old_skitch=10010))

PNG, GIF, and JPEG are all acceptable submission formats. GIF or PNG are preferred for images in which text features prominently. (Don’t use JPEG for pictures with logos, a screenshot of a web page, etc.)

##Author Bios

Author bios should be 45 to 70 words long and may include links. They should be snappy, informative, and brief.

Example:

> Eric Harsh is a third year Industrial Design student at the University of Cincinnati and an avid beard enthusiast. In Cincinnati he spends the majority of his time in studio drawing toasters until his eyes bleed. When not working on  projects, he enjoys playing guitar and violin, and staring wistfully out windows thinking of the past. You don’t want to see his twitter. It’s…dark. (65 words)

Author photos don’t need to be professional portraits, but should look polished. A designer will prepare them for publication, so please send them to your editor as an un-tweaked file with a minimum size of 400px by 400px.

##House Style

In general, we use U.S. English according to the *Chicago Manual of Style*, with *Garner’s Modern American Usage* taking over in tricky situations.

###ARTICLE TITLES, HEADLINES, and SUBHEADS
Title case article titles (each major word is uppercase). 
Sentence case article headings (only the initial word is uppercase). 
Neither take terminal punctuation unless a question mark is required. 
Article titles do not take the serial comma and use the ampersand in place of “and.” Article headings do take the serial comma and use the word “and.”

Article titles are automatically set as `h1`. Subheads are `h3` or `h4` as needed. Most article headings are conceptually and rhetorically at the same level as each other; avoid unnecessary complexity and mark them up as `h3` unless they’re sub-subheads.

Article title or document title

> Fat, Loud & Overbearing

Article header or subhead

> Fat, loud, and overbearing

####Capitalization for titles and headings

When using title case, capitalize the first, last, and all other major words. 
Lowercase “and,” “but,” “for,” “or,” and “nor” unless they are emphasized in a particular heading.

Examples:

> A New Hope for Embedded Fonts

> Arguments For and Against FIR Strike Back

When a headline-style heading includes a hyphenated phrase, always capitalize the first element. 
Capitalize the second element unless it is an article, preposition, or any of the coordinating conjunctions noted above. 
Exception: if the first element is a prefix like pre-, post-, or anti-, or if the phrase is a written-out number, do not capitalize the second element.

###LISTS

* If any item in a list (ordered or not) forms a complete sentence, all items must begin with a capital letter and end with a terminal punctuation mark.
* If no items in an unordered list form a complete sentence, skip the capitalization and terminal punctuation.
* If the items in the list complete an unfinished introductory sentence, end all but the last item with a semicolon, add an “and” before the final item, and finish off with terminal punctuation.

###LINKING

Choose link text that concisely indicates the nature of the linked document. Do not link terminal punctuation. Prefer shorter links to long ones.

Alt-attribute text uses sentence-casing.

####Title-attribute text

You may attach title text to links to convey additional information. Many web browsers display this information when the user’s cursor hovers over a link. A useful title attribute for an outbound link might read:

> The results of Steve Chowders’s 2004 study on brain trauma.

Title-attribute text uses sentence-casing.

####Alt-attribute text (Images)

Accompany each illustrative image with alt-attribute text that concisely describes the image for those who cannot see it.

Examples:

> **Good**: Illustration of Vladimir Putin riding a donkey.

> **Bad**: Cartoon image.

###PUNCTUATION

**The ampersand**: Avoid the use of the ampersand except in article and page titles.

**Citations**: The titles of books and other major works as well as the titles of magazines and newspapers are marked up with the `cite` or `em` element for italic emphasis. The titles of articles and other short works are enclosed in quotation marks.

**Commas**: Use the serial comma (the comma preceding the “and” before the last element in a list) except in headlines and subheads.

**Company and publication names**: Capitalize the names of companies according to each company’s preference unless they begin a sentence, in which case they must be capitalized. Do not capitalize or otherwise emphasize the definite article before the name of a publication—even the *New York Times*.

**Em dashes**: Do not leave a space on either side of the em dash. Use the en dash for enumerated date ranges (e.g. 1400–1800).

**Hyphens**: Hyphenate compound noun phrases used as adjectives unless the noun phrase is so popularly used that hyphenation appears awkward. Do not hyphenate compound adjectival phrases whose first element is an adverb.

**Quotations**: Position punctuation according to Chicago rules (periods and commas go on the inside, etc.). Use block quotes for more substantial quotations. Use the correct (“curly”) symbols, not a double prime. 

**Single Quote Mark**: As nice as they are, single quotation marks are not used except to demarcate quotations within quotations and in place of double quatation marks or italics in an article title.
