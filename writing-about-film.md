##Writing About Film

*This section is under development*

Any writing about films or television shows should fall into one of two categories:

1. [Recommendation](#recommendation)
2. [Criticism](#criticism)

These two types of writing shouldn't cross into one another as a combination will detract from singular intent. 

The Airspace doesn't publish movie reviews. However, this does not mean our writing doesn't contain review elements.

###Recommendation

If you want to tell somebody to go to a film or avoid it, you shouldn't reveal more than any trailer or summary would. A simple formula is all that's required. 

**Summary + Action = Recommendation**

Example

> Robot lovers in space fighting time demons. Totally worth the money. Go see it in theaters.

> French artists listen to loud music and complain. Only watch it if it's on TV and all other movies have been removed from Earth in a freak accident.

At the Airspace we don't currently write many recommendations. Our "Review in Haiku" series is as close as we get. They contain an image from the film, a short summary, and an opinion directed toward an action.

###Criticism

The other side of film writing belongs to criticism and this is the most important type of writing.

A critic should truly understand a film, the canon of film preceding it, and the history of the players who created the film.

Criticism should demand that the reader have seen the film.

At the Airspace, we will never issue a "Spoiler Warning." Any written criticism is a short monologue in the dialogue a film creates. If the plot is off-limits, there's nowhere for discussion to begin.
